### SQL Scripts
The repository contains 10 SQL scripts, each designed to address a specific analysis question. These scripts demonstrate the use of joins, aggregations, and other SQL techniques to extract and transform data directly within the database.

### 1. Total Sales by Category
This query calculates the total sales revenue generated by each product category. It helps identify the most profitable categories and understand the sales # distribution across different product types.

      SELECT c.category_name, 
           SUM(oi.quantity * oi.list_price * (1 - oi.discount)) AS total_sales
      FROM order_items oi
      JOIN products p ON oi.product_id = p.product_id
      JOIN categories c ON p.category_id = c.category_id
      GROUP BY c.category_name
      ORDER BY total_sales DESC;


### 2. Top Selling Products
This query identifies the top 5 best-selling products based on the total quantity sold. It helps understand customer preferences and product popularity.

      SELECT p.product_id, p.product_name, SUM(oi.quantity) AS total_quantity_sold
      FROM order_items oi
      JOIN products p ON oi.product_id = p.product_id
      GROUP BY p.product_id, p.product_name
      ORDER BY total_quantity_sold DESC
      LIMIT 5;
 

### 3. Sales Trend Over Time (Monthly)
This query analyzes the sales trend over time, aggregating total sales by month. It helps visualize sales patterns, seasonality, and overall business growth.

        TO_CHAR(o.order_date, 'YYYY-MM') AS month_year,
        SUM(oi.quantity * oi.list_price * (1 - oi.discount)) AS total_sales
      FROM
        orders o
        JOIN order_items oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id

                  customer_id
              ) AS subquery1
          ) THEN 'High'
          WHEN COUNT(*) < (
            SELECT
              AVG(order_count) - STDDEV(order_count)
            FROM
              (
                SELECT
                  customer_id,
